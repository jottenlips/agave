This page demonstrates how this theme renders various markdown elements.

## Typography

Regular paragraph text looks like this. Agave converts markdown to static HTML with zero JavaScript. Themes control fonts, colors, layout, and mood.

**Bold text** and *italic text* and `inline code` all styled by the theme.

### Third-level heading

A smaller heading for subsections.

## Code Block

```
// A code block to see how the theme styles preformatted text
fn main() {
    println!("The spice must flow.");
}
```
