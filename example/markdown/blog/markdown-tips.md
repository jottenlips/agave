# Markdown Tips and Tricks

Get the most out of your Agave markdown files.

## Headings Structure

Use `#` for the page title, `##` for sections, and `###` for subsections. Agave will automatically extract the first heading for meta tags if you don't specify `@title`.

## Code Blocks

Wrap code in triple backticks for syntax highlighting:

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello from Agave!";
console.log(greeting);
```

## Lists

Both ordered and unordered lists work great:

- Bullet points with `-`
- Nested items supported
  - Like this one

1. Numbered lists
2. Auto-increment
3. Easy to maintain

## Links and Images

Standard markdown links and images are fully supported. Use relative paths for internal links to keep your site portable.
