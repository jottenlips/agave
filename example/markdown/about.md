# About Agave

Agave is a lightweight static site generator that turns markdown files into a website.

## Features

- Markdown to HTML conversion
- Custom templates with `base.html`
- Per-page meta tags via shorthand notation
- Built-in themes (arrakis, caladan, giediprime, ix, salusasecundus, spice)
- Client-side searchable sitemap
- Local dev server

## How It Works

Drop your `.md` files into a directory, add a `base.html` template, and run `agave`. That's it.
